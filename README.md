# Big-Bash-League-Analysis
The repository contains the code, Power BI dashboard and a structured report exploring and analyzing data from the 2022/23 season of the Big Bash League, a widely popular cricket league, conducted in Australia.

- Cleaned and filtered the data using 'dplyr' package to facilitate further analysis. The data contained 124270 rows and 33 variables, out of which 14168 rows were of interest.
- Extracted data from reliable sources on the internet, and also manually captured some data obtained through resources.
- Built appropriate graphs using 'ggplot2' package, displaying unique insights about the data and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) relevant to the field.
- Created a dashboard on Power BI after obtaining the filtered data from R. Quick measures and interactive charts were used to create the dashboard on Power BI.
